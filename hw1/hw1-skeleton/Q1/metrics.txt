Average node degree:1.110
Diameter of the gragh:6
Average path length:4.017
Graph density:0.002

Avergae node degree computes the average of the number of edges that are connected to each node, indicates how connective the graph is.
Diameter of the graph is the longest path length between any two nodes which shows how far apart are the two most distant nodes.
Avergate path length is the average graph path length between all pairs of nodes.
Graph density is the ratio of the number of existing edges and the number of all possible edges between any two nodes, indicates how dense the graph is.
